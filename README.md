# Project Owl
## Software - OWL 🦉

Website:  https://project-owl-ruby-17-zany-wolverine.mybluemix.net/

Manage large and small disasters with the Owl incident management system.  Owl is designed to offer a fast, simple incident management experience --- just by talking to it.

Project Owl is a Ruby on Rails web application hosted on IBM Cloud leveraging the IBM Watson Studio, IBM Watson Cloud APIs, Weather Company APIs, Google Maps API, and public data sets.

## Hardware - ClusterDuck 🐥
Deploy Owl incident management to geographies without active communications or infrastructure through the `ClusterDuck` Mobile Network.  This network is made of portable IoT WiFi devices - called `Ducks` - that provide an ad-hoc network solution.

`ClusterDuck` is prototyped over **Arduino, with a WiFi/LoRa solution** and levarages IBM's IoT Platform, Node-RED, Cloudant DB, and Cloud Foundry.

## Open Source Software

As a developer you can build experiences for Owl Software.  These experiences are accessible from the conversational interface.  Examples of experiences to create for Owl are:  a weather forecasting app, and leadership and management structure app, messaging app, a translation app, or a predictive data analytics app.

We are looking for passionate developers who would like to contribute to this software ecosystem.  While the app development environment is under construction for Owl please reach out to bryan.knouse@gmail.com if you are interested in contributing and we will provide more information about the technology and how to build with it.

Apps for Owl are created simply using HTML, CSS, and JS.  If you have built a web site before, you can build an app for Owl.


## Open Source Hardware
#### ClusterDuck + QuackPack
The `ClusterDuck` hardware solution would also allow passionate developers and OEMs to build on top of our hardware, via lego-like modules called **QuackPacks**. In addition to relaying civilian data, additional `Quacks` would allow `Ducks` to send additional useful and crucial data via sensors such as, **temperature**, **water-pressure**, **smoke**, **gas**, and a lot more!

**QuackHackers** will be provided with boilerplate libraries in order for your `QuackPacks` to work with our `Ducks`.

## Project Roadmap

The Owl is currently a cloud software prototype and is being tested in simulated incidents.  The ClusterDuck hardware also has been manufactured as a prototype and is being tested to prepare for field experiments.
