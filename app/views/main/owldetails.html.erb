					<h2>Just Talk to OWL</h2>
					<p>Leverage all of OWL's incident management capabilities just by talking to it.  The conversational interface provides an intuitive experience critical for environments where it is hard to think straight; for the tired, the dirty, and the hungry responders.</p>
					<br><br>
					<h2>Paired with a Graphical Interface</h2>
					<p>Within OWL are traditional visual user interfaces as well to provide the most intuitive possible experience for individuals who want to spend time recovering from disasters, not playing around on a laptop.</p>
